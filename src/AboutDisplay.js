        <p>A Pokédex is a digital encyclopedia that catalogues information about the various species of Pokémon, the fictional creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe. It is an essential tool for Pokémon trainers who use it to keep track of the various types of Pokémon they encounter on their journey.
The Pokédex typically contains detailed information about each Pokémon, including its name, type, abilities, moves, and stats. It also includes a detailed description of the Pokémon's appearance, behavior, and habitat, as well as any special characteristics or abilities that it may possess.
In addition to providing information about individual Pokémon, the Pokédex also allows trainers to compare and contrast different species, helping them to make strategic decisions when battling other trainers or wild Pokémon.
In the Pokémon games, the Pokédex is typically a handheld device that is given to the player at the start of their journey. As the player encounters and captures new Pokémon, the Pokédex automatically updates with information about each one, encouraging the player to explore the world and collect as many Pokémon as possible.
